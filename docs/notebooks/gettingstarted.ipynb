    "This package is designed to aid in the efficient analysis of large simulations, such as cosmological (hydrodynamical) simulations of large-scale structure.\n",

    "It uses the [dask](https://dask.org/) library to perform computations, which has several key advantages:\n",
    "* (i) very large datasets which cannot normally fit into memory can be analyzed,\n",
    "* (ii) calculations can be automatically distributed onto parallel 'workers', across one or more nodes, to speed them up.\n",
    "* (iii) we can create abstract graphs (\"recipes\", such as for derived quantities) and only evaluate on actual demand."

To start, we will intentionally select the $z=0$ output of TNG50-4, which is the lowest resolution version of [TNG50](https://www.tng-project.org/), a suite for galaxy formation simulations in cosmological volumes. Choosing TNG50-4 means that the data size in the snapshot is small and easy to work with. We demonstrate how to work with larger data sets at a later stage."
