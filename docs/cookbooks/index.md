# Cookbooks

Contains cookbooks for various tasks. Each cookbook is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates specific tasks using scida,
giving a more in-depth hands-on compared to the tutorial. More material will be added over time. You can download the
underlying notebooks from the [scida repository](https://github.com/cbyrohl/scida/tree/main/docs/cookbooks). Many
notebooks require access to various data sets. You can learn more about most
datasets [supported data](../supported_data.md) here. For astrophysical simulations, your easiest way to work with the
data is to use the [TNGLab](../supported_data.md#tnglab) online.
